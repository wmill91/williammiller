<p align="center"><p3>Berlin is a symbol of what has been lost, and what has been gained. Before the Berlin Wall</br>
	was torn down, a Socialist state wore down the lives of Germans all over East Berlin.</br>
	Seeing the marks on the city from Soclialism and how far they have come would be irreplaceable.
